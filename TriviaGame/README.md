# Wheel of Fortune

## Anatomy of the Brain
 - I wanted to do a sample quiz for like educational testing. I enjoyed also learning about different parts of the brain as well. I wanted it to be fun, colorful because of the images I have found on the web was colorful. I wanted to keep the colors flowing throughout the quiz. 

 ## Roadblocks
 - Using the 'this' object in my constructor, I struggled with what exactly it was asking so I had to ask mulitple times as well. I also struggled with my radio buttons being selected  _only once_  then continue to the next question. I was allowing them to continue selecting even after they got it wrong.
